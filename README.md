# GUI Package Manager for VSCode

![GUI Package Manager Banner]

## 📌 Overview
The **GUI Package Manager** is a Visual Studio Code extension that provides an intuitive graphical interface for managing installed npm packages. Inspired by JetBrains IDEs but designed to be more streamlined and accessible, this extension makes package management straightforward and efficient.

🔹 **Visualize installed packages** with an easy-to-navigate GUI.
🔹 **Identify redundant packages** that cause unnecessary server-side load and dependency conflicts.
🔹 **Resolve dependency conflicts** more efficiently with clear, actionable insights rather than cryptic CLI messages.
🔹 **Open-source and community-driven**, built to improve the package management experience for developers.
